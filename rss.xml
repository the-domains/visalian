            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bernie Sanders Misses Chance to Explain Why D.C.'s Rich Outlive U.S.'s Poor</h1><p>WITH THE WEST VIRGINIA primary five days away, Bernie Sanders traveled Thursday to the state's impoverished McDowell County, which has the lowest male life expectancy in the country. During a campaign speech there, he cited the disparity in life expectancy between McDowell and Fairfax, Virginia, a prosperous suburb of Washington, D.C.: The average life expectancy for men in this county is just 64 years.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/32e2d5d0b0fca939a6c4fe81be1ae217b4efeae0.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Introducing the organisation that will kill corporations</h1><p>Imagine a world where companies didn't exist. Instead of corporate entities being brought into existence through statute, networks of individuals would work, co-operate and generate wealth via DAOs - decentralised autonomous organisations. The hierarchical, centrally governed organisations we're all so familiar with would not be needed.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6ad8d79efae49f02d1ab9dd4091ca8daab415cd5.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Satoshi Is Actually Building an Ethereum Company (and Other Developments)</h1><p>I'm a big believer in transparency when it comes to systems that greatly affect lots of people (or have the potential to).
