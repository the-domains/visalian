Probably the worst source of reliable information is the current crop of presidential candidates.

Surfacing in the news this past week with drama and fanfare, it's an unprecedented revelation that has divided legal experts, and given our collective Big Brother paranoia and infosec hysteria a shot in the arm that we really didn't need.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/18892fbbf3d8cecf66fdc1eb5786301d9708156c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Instead of corporate entities being brought into existence through statute, networks of individuals would work, co-operate and generate wealth via DAOs - decentralised autonomous organisations.
