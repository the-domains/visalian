            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How Armenian gangsters blew up the fingerprint-password debate</h1><p>Much ado has been made over a Los Angeles judge's February decision to grant a search warrant allowing authorities to take Bkhchadzhyan's fingerprint and use it to unlock her iPhone. Surfacing in the news this past week with drama and fanfare, it's an unprecedented revelation that has divided legal experts, and given our collective Big Brother paranoia and infosec hysteria a shot in the arm that we really didn't need.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/18892fbbf3d8cecf66fdc1eb5786301d9708156c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Homeland security want to subpoena Techdirt over the identity of a hyperbolic commenter</h1><p>This week, Techdirt's Tim Cushing published a story about the Hancock County, IN Sheriff's Department officers who stole $240,000 under color of asset forfeiture. Digger, a Techdirt commenter, remarked, "The only 'bonus' these criminals [the Sheriff's Department officers] are likely to see could be a bullet to their apparently empty skulls."</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/72f341cf14038872a17ae432bc2181da9b48f368.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Introducing the organisation that will kill corporations</h1><p>Imagine a world where companies didn't exist. Instead of corporate entities being brought into existence through statute, networks of individuals would work, co-operate and generate wealth via DAOs - decentralised autonomous organisations. The hierarchical, centrally governed organisations we're all so familiar with would not be needed.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6ad8d79efae49f02d1ab9dd4091ca8daab415cd5.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Satoshi Is Actually Building an Ethereum Company (and Other Developments)</h1><p>I'm a big believer in transparency when it comes to systems that greatly affect lots of people (or have the potential to).

Wedge: Alexa, CES and The Difference Between Amazon and Apple Smart Home Strategies</h1><p>The early consensus coming out of CES is that Amazon Alexa was the star of the show. Not only did the virtual assistant technology and its physical manifestation in Echo dislodge Nest as the sexy integration partner that everyone clamors to put in their press release and on their consumer packaging, but you could sense a palpable excitement on the show floor about the potential of the voice-powered virtual assistant.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e25453e61344346396138fbf86c6499a609a0d79.png"></article>]]></description>
