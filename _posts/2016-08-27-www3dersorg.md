  Aug 15, 2016 | By Alec 3D scanning takes many shapes and forms, but all take
  something from LiDAR (Light detection and ranging). This has been around since
  the invention of the laser itself, and uses light beams to find out exactly
  where pixels are in 3D space by measuring the returning signal.
