  I've been working lately on preparing nightly builds of Visual Studio Code for
  ARM and Intel. These are now ready, and can be downloaded at
  https://code.headmelted.com. These "just work" on Raspberry Pi same as any
  other packaged software (for the most part), and a script is provided to make
  these builds run well on Chromebooks, too.
