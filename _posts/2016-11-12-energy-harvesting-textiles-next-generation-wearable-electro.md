  The latest development by researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology is a
  fabric that can simultaneously harvest energy from both sunshine and motion.
  By combining two types of electricity generation into one textile allowed the
  garments to provide their own source of energy that is strong enough to power
  devices such as your smart phone.
